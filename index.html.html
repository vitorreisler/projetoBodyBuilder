        <h2>Bodybuilding</h2>
            <p>
                Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and 
                developone's muscles (muscle building) by muscle hypertrophy for aesthetic 
                purposes. It is distinct from similar activities such as powerlifting because it 
                focuses on physical appearance instead of strength. An individual who engages in 
                this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.
            </p>

            <p>
                In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified
                poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them 
                based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation.
                Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body
                fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and
                carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also 
                tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights.
                
            </p>
        
            <p>
                A bodybuilder performs the incline dumbbell press.
                Bodybuilding takes a great amount of effort and time to reach the desired results.
                A bodybuilder might first be able to gain 8–20 pounds (4–9 kg) of muscle per year, 
                if lifting for seven hours on a weekly basis. However, gains begin to slow down 
                after the first two years to about 5–15 pounds (2–7 kg). After five years gains 
                can decrease to just 3–10 pounds (1–5 kg).
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to 
                build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes 
                ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair 
                competition. Despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding 
                federation (National physique Committee) does not require testing.
            </p>
        
            
            <p>
                The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the
                world's top male professional bodybuilder. Since 1950, the NABBA Universe
                Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with 
                notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

            <h2> History</h2>

            <h3>Early history</h3>
                <p>
                    Stone-lifting traditions were practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, and 
                    Tamilakam Western weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with
                    strongmen displaying feats of strength for the public and challenging each 
                    other. The focus was not on their physique, and they possessed relatively 
                    large bellies and fatty limbs compared to bodybuilders of today.
                </p>
            <h3>Eugen Sandow</h3>
                <p>
                    Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German 
                    Eugen Sandow, now considered as the "Father of Modern Bodybuilding". He 
                    allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in "muscle display 
                    performances". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed 
                    physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength 
                    demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around 
                    these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld. The Oscar-winning 1936
                    musical film The Great Ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding,
                    when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later 
                    created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market 
                    products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the
                     first exercise equipment for the masses: machined dumbbells, spring pulleys,
                      and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in "cabinet 
                      cards" and other prints.
                </p>
            <h3>First large-scale bodybuilding competition</h3>
                <p>
                    Sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called 
                    the "Great Competition". It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London.Judged 
                    by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the contest was a 
                    great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the 
                    overwhelming number of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner 
                    was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was 
                    William L. Murray of Nottingham. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to 
                    second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy – now the most famous
                    of all – was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe. In 1950, this same 
                    bronze trophy was presented to Steve Reeves for winning the inaugural NABBA 
                    Mr. Universe contest. It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner
                    of the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest, Frank Zane, was presented with a replica of
                    the bronze trophy. Since then, Mr. Olympia winners have been consistently 
                    awarded a replica of the bronze Sandow
                </p>

                                    This category is also fairly new, introduced at the Olympia in the 2012. The judges pay close attention to Athletic, Less Muscularity and an Aesthetic physique. In other words, they focus more on the body that has an appealing structure and impressive shoulder to waist ratio (52.5″ to 27″ of former champion Jeremy Buendia), extraordinary and balanced development of Arms, Calves, Chest, Back and Shoulders. Also, the division’s competitors need to wear shorts slightly below the knee-length, and not much preference is given to the thigh development because it is hidden below the clothing. The final condition is that competitors are required to have body fat percentage less than 5%. This posing routine is different from other divisions with a regular posing routine which is replaced by the Front position followed by three-quarter turns. Australian Professional Men's Physique competitors Ali Raza and Viet Doan are vying to qualify for their Olympia debuts after becoming IFBB Pros.

                                    The Classic Physique division was introduced in the 2016, and it’s one of the newest divisions in the Olympia. This division is targeted to men who want to build their muscles and size above the normal Men’s Physique limits (discussed later), but not to the extent of Open Division Bodybuilding.

                                    With modern bodybuilding being ridiculed because of the steroid abuse in the path of becoming big, bodybuilders are unable to control their stomachs due to the enlargement of their intestines and other mid torso organs. Also, the extreme muscular development can lead to a loss of the aesthetic appearance of bodybuilding, which is retained in Classic Physique. In this case, the stomach must remain many firm inches inwards as stated by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who made bodybuilding famous in the Classic Era or Golden Era, where the bodybuilders worked more on beautiful and aesthetic appearance.

                                    This division was introduced in the 2011 and was notably recommended for short men that cannot accumulate as much muscle compared to the taller open division competitors. The requirements for this class, just as the name implies, is that the athlete needs to weigh up to and under 212 Lb (i.e., 96.6 kg) and they must be less than 166cm or 5’5 of height. These bodybuilders must put on tiny underwear, and they have to accomplish the seven basic bodybuilding postures. They are judged based on their muscle mass, conditioning and separations.

                                    This is also referred to as the MV division in the Olympia. All the top players participate here with their weights starting from 300 lbs or 137 kgs. The biggest performers compete together, and after all that mass they have to work on their conditioning as well, which is the most difficult part for these competitors. Presently, it is dominated by Phil Health, a title holder for the 7th time winning streak which equals Arnold’s record. This streak hasn't triumphed Ronnie Colman and Lee Haney's record of 8 title wins each, even when legends such as Jay Cutler, Dennis James and Shawn Ray were competing.
