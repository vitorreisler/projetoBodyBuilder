    <h2>Gastrointestinal tract</h2>
        <p>
            The gastrointestinal tract (GI tract, digestive tract, alimentary canal) is the 
            tract or passageway of the digestive system that leads from the mouth to the anus 
            The GI tract contains all the major organs of the digestive system, in humans and 
            other animals, including the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Food taken in 
            through the mouth is digested to extract nutrients and absorb energy, and the 
            waste expelled at the anus as feces. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of 
            or pertaining to the stomach and intestines.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most animals have a "through-gut" or complete digestive tract. Exceptions are more
            primitive ones: sponges have small pores (ostia) throughout their body for 
            digestion and a larger dorsal pore (osculum) for excretion, comb jellies have 
            both a ventral mouth and dorsal anal pores, while cnidarians and acoels have a 
            single pore for both digestion and excretion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus, stomach, and 
            intestines, and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts. The 
            GI tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus forming a 
            continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion, namely, the 
            stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. The complete human digestive system 
            is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion 
            (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver and gallbladder). The tract may also 
            be divided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut, reflecting the embryological origin 
            of each segment. The whole human GI tract is about nine metres (30 feet) long at 
            autopsy. It is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines, 
            which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue, maintain constant muscle tone in a 
            halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and 
            peristalsis.
        </p>
        <p>
            The gastrointestinal tract contains the gut microbiota, with some 4,000 different 
            strains of bacteria having diverse roles in maintenance of immune health and 
            metabolism, and many other microorganisms. Cells of the GI tract release 
            hormones to help regulate the digestive process. These digestive hormones, 
            including gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and ghrelin, are mediated through 
            either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms, indicating that the cells releasing 
            these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution

        <h2>Human gastrointestinal tract</h2>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
            <p>
                The structure and function can be described both as gross anatomy and as 
                microscopic anatomy or histology. The tract itself is divided into upper and 
                lower tracts, and the intestines small and large parts.
            </p>
        <h2>Upper gastrointestinal tract</h2>
            <p> 
                Main articles: Mouth, Pharynx, Esophagus, Stomach, and duodenum
                The upper gastrointestinal tract consists of the mouth, pharynx, esophagus,
                stomach, and duodenum. The exact demarcation between the upper and lower 
                tracts is the suspensory muscle of the duodenum. This differentiates the 
                embryonic borders between the foregut and midgut, and is also the division 
                commonly used by clinicians to describe gastrointestinal bleeding as being of
                either "upper" or "lower" origin. Upon dissection, the duodenum may appear 
                to be a unified organ, but it is divided into four segments based upon 
                function, location, and internal anatomy. The four segments of the duodenum 
                are as follows (starting at the stomach, and moving toward the jejunum): 
                bulb, descending, horizontal, and ascending. The suspensory muscle attaches 
                the superior border of the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm.
