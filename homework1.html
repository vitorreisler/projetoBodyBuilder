        <h2>Injuries</h2>
            <p>
                An injury is any physiological damage to living tissue caused by immediate 
                physical stress. An injury can occur intentionally or unintentionally and may
                be caused by blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, burning, toxic exposure, 
                asphyxiation, or overexertion. Injuries can occur in any part of the body, and 
                different symptoms are associated with different injuries.
                Treatment of a major injury is typically carried out by a health professional 
                and varies greatly depending on the nature of the injury. Traffic collisions 
                are the most common cause of accidental injury and injury-related death among 
                humans. Injuries are distinct from chronic conditions, psychological trauma, 
                infections, or medical procedures, though injury can be a contributing factor
                 to any of these.
        
                Several major health organizations have established systems for the 
                classification and description of human injuries.

        <h2>Occurrences</h2>
            <p>
                Injuries may be intentional or unintentional. Intentional injuries may be acts
                 of violence against others or self-harm against one's own person. Accidental
                 injuries may be unforeseeable or they may be caused by negligence The most 
                common types of unintentional injuries in order are traffic accidents, falls,
                 drowning, burns, and accidental poisoning. Certain types of injuries are more 
                common in developed countries or developing countries. Traffic injuries are 
                more likely to kill pedestrians than drivers in developing countries. Scalding 
                burns are more common in developed countries, while open-flame injuries are 
                more common in developing countries.
                As of 2021, approximately 4.4 million people are killed due to injuries each 
                year worldwide, constituting nearly 8% of all deaths. 3.16 million of these
                 injuries are unintentional and 1.25 million are intentional. Traffic accidents
                 are the most common form of deadly injury, causing about one-third of
                 injury-related deaths. One-sixth are caused by suicide, and one-tenth are
                 caused by homicide. Tens of millions of individuals require medical treatment
                 for nonfatal injuries each year, and injuries are responsible for about 10% of
                 all years lived with disability. Men are twice as likely to be killed through
                 injury than women. In 2013, 367,000 children under the age of five died from
                 injuries, down from 766,000 in 1990.

        <h2>Classification systems</h2>
            <p>
                The World Health Organization (WHO) developed the International Classification 
                of External Causes of Injury (ICECI). Under this system, injuries are 
                classified by mechanism of injury, objects/substances producing injury, place 
                of occurrence, activity when injured, the role of human intent, and additional 
                modules. These codes allow the identification of distributions of injuries in 
                specific populations and case identification for more detailed research on 
                causes and preventive efforts.


                The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics developed the Occupational Injury
                and Illness Classification System (OIICS). Under this system injuries are 
                classified by nature, part of body affected, source and secondary source, and
                 event or exposure. The OIICS was first published in 1992 and has been updated
                 several times since. The Orchard Sports Injury and Illness Classification 
                 System (OSIICS), previously OSICS, is used to classify injuries to enable 
                 research into specific sports injuries.
                

                The injury severity score (ISS) is a medical score to assess trauma severity. 
                It correlates with mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization time after 
                trauma. It is used to define the term major trauma (polytrauma), recognized
                 when the ISS is greater than 15. The AIS Committee of the Association for the 
                 Advancement of Automotive Medicine designed and updates the scale.

        <h2>Mechanisms</h2>
        <h3>Trauma</h3>
                <p>
                    Traumatic injury is caused by an external object making forceful contact with 
                    the body, resulting in a wound. Major trauma is a severe traumatic injury that
                    has the potential to cause disability or death. Serious traumatic injury most
                    often occurs as a result of traffic collisions. Traumatic injury is the 
                    leading cause of death in people under the age of 45.

                    Blunt trauma injuries are caused by the forceful impact of an external object.
                    Injuries from blunt trauma may cause internal bleeding and bruising from 
                    ruptured capillaries beneath the skin, abrasion from scraping against the 
                    superficial epidermis, lacerated tears on the skin or internal organs, or 
                    bone fractures. Crush injuries are a severe form of blunt trauma damage that 
                    apply large force to a large area over a longer period of time.
                    Penetrating trauma injuries are caused by external objects entering the 
                    tissue of the body through the skin. Low-velocity penetration injuries are 
                    caused by sharp objects, such as stab wounds, while high-velocity penetration
                    injuries are caused by ballistic projectiles, such as gunshot wounds or 
                    injuries caused by shell fragments. Perforated injuries result in an 
                    entry wound and an exit wound, while puncture wounds result only in an entry 
                    wound. Puncture injuries result in a cavity in the tissue.
